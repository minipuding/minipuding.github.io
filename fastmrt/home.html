        <p>FastMRT is a collaborative research project between Facebook AI and NYU Langone Health that aims to improve the speed and quality of MRI scans for thermometery. Our goal is to make MRI scans up to 10x faster while maintaining or even improving image quality. We believe that faster MRI scans will improve the patient experience, increase access to MRI, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.</p>
        <p>Our team of researchers and engineers are working on developing new machine learning algorithms and hardware solutions to achieve this goal. We are also working with clinical partners to validate our methods and ensure that they are safe and effective for patients.</p>

      <h2>Our Research</h2>
      <p>At FastMRT, we are working on developing new machine learning algorithms and hardware solutions to improve the speed and quality of MRI scans for thermometery. Our research focuses on three main areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Image Reconstruction:</strong> We are developing new algorithms to reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled MRI data. By reducing the amount of data needed for each scan, we can make MRI scans faster without sacrificing image quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware Acceleration:</strong> We are exploring new hardware solutions to accelerate MRI scans. By optimizing the hardware used in MRI machines, we can reduce scan times and improve patient throughput.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation and Clinical Translation:</strong> We are working with clinical partners to validate our methods and ensure that they are safe and effective for patients. We are also exploring ways to integrate our methods into clinical workflows to improve patient outcomes.</li>
      </ul>
